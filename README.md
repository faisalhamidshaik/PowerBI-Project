# PowerBI-Project
This is a powerBI project which uses the dataset taken from kaggle and derive some meaningful insights. In this project, our aim was to analyze industry-related data using public datasets sourced from platforms such as Kaggle. Our primary objectives include selecting manageable datasets, designing a dashboard with 4-6 charts, integrating at least 2 filters, and implementing a "drill through" feature for deeper insights. We  prioritized adherence to best practices in dashboard design to ensure clarity and user-friendliness. Additionally, we focused on effectively communicating our findings and recommendations through a PowerPoint deliverable, showcasing our process, dashboard design, and key insights derived from the data.
